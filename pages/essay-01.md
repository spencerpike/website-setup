## Introduction

War has always been a part of our history since we won our independence from Great Britain in 1776. While war has been rich in our history, it wasn't until the start of the 20th century that America would be forever changed by wartime. No one could have predicted how the events of WWI and WWII would impact America in the years to come. Ever since the conclusion of WWII, the political landscape of America has shifted to focus more on militaristic ideas and innovative ways that we can protect our country going forward. Wartime has also affected how Americans see its leaders and how it factors into their decisions on who should run the country.
