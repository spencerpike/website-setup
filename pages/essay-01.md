# How Wartime Changed America's Political Landscape

{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic="America at war" %} 
This graph shows a very good demonstration of how often wartime was mentionded during State of the Union Addresses from 1900-2000. As you can see, after WWI and WWII, many Presidents would consistently use the term 'war' more on average after the conclusion of the wars compared to before the wars took place.


## Introduction

War has always been a part of our history since we won our independence from Great Britain in 1776. While war has been rich in our history, it wasn't until the start of the 20th century that America would be forever changed by wartime. No one could have predicted how the events of WWI and WWII would impact America in the years to come. Ever since the conclusion of WWII, the political landscape of America has shifted to focus more on militaristic ideas and innovative ways that we can protect our country going forward. Wartime has also affected how Americans see its leaders and how it factors into their decisions on who should run the country. America has always done a good job of electing someone who can run the country at a high level with the country's best interests in mind. With America's implications in two world wars, the political landscape of America was forever changed and influences people's political views to this day.


## The Great War

The Great War, commonly referred to as WWI, lasted from 1914-1918. The most notable countries involved in this war were Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, and the United States. At the time the war started, the United States had mostly followed an isolationist political view when it came to our invovlemnt in other country's affairs. Isolationism can be defined as remaining apart from the affairs or interests of other countries. While Americans had held this political view for many years, as the war endured, many Americans had started to move away from the Isolationist view and move toward a more interventionist political view. Even so, President Woodrow Wilson was reluctant to join the war, despite many Americans believing that we should intervene. The U.S. would not enter the war until 1917, amid finding out that Germany was encouraging Mexico to attack the U.S. Woodrow Wilson declard war on Germany and the other central poweres on April 6th, 1917. When the U.S. entered the war, many Americans started to believe a new political view of 'Wilsonianism.' The Wilsonianism point of view is the belief that "the growth of democracy abroad makes the United States more secure at home" (105).
